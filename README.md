# KAGGLE TITANIC
Hello, welcome to my github :)

In this notebook I will describe my process to predict if passengers survived the Titanic disaster. 
This is a nice classification problem where you can learn techniques that can be applied on many real life scenarios !

This project comes from a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

This competition is essentially a practice that I did after refreshing my memory on machine learning, I applied basic principles in order to have a simple but effective code that performs reasonably well.

I tried to make the code as readable and simple as possible, if something is not clear please send me a message.

In the same fashion, if you spot some mistakes, bad practices or bits that could be improved, by all means tell me so I can learn as well :)

Side note: although you can reach a nice position in the leaderboard by copying and pasting this code (currently TOP 8% out of 18.000 teams), this notebook is intended to learn about data science, not to perform well in a competition.
This is why I am not using some "unethical" techniques such as using data leakage voluntarily which could allow my code to perform better in this competition - but worse in a hypotethical real life scenario :)

If you really want to get in the top 1%, please have a look at this excellent notebook that describes how to get a model with 100% accuracy on this specific dataset:

I wish you a nice time learning
